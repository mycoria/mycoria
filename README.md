# Mycoria

Mycoria is an open and secure overlay network that connects all participants. It values freedom of connectivity and aims to imitate the curious and adventurous spirit of the early Internet:

- __Everyone is equal__: Easily connect to anyone
- __Everyone is welcome__: Open network without bureaucracy
- No spooking: Everthing is authenticated
- No surveillance: Everything is encrypted (+ Private Addresses!)
- No barriers: Connect via the Internet or extend Mycoria with your own mesh

### Design Goals

- Keep it small and simple
- Compatible with existing infrastructure (eg. DNS)
- __Secure by default__
- Private by default (WIP)

### Features

- __Automatic end-to-end encryption__
- Modern cryptography
- Smart and scalable routing
- Dashboard ([Screenshots](https://mycoria.org/#dashboard-impressions))
- Resolve .myco DNS (OS configuration required)
- Simple Service Discovery
- Auto-Optimization/Healing of Network (for Internet overlay) (WIP)
- Rotating private addresses (WIP)
